## My process

This project was built using semantic HTML5 and CSS3. I chose to build this without additional frameworks in order to leverage and hone my CSS skills.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As my second FrontEnd Mentor project, I was proud to be able to continue to hone my base CSS skills, utilizing transitions and hover effects to accurately match the Figma designs. I focused more on utilizing semantic HTML, and paid more closer attention to finer details such as font-line height and box-shadows. Additionally, I utilized transitions to give the hover effects more of a smooth animation.
